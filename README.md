# Tax Calcuator for MA Income Tax
An application developed for the purpose to calculate the MA income tax amount for an inputted salary, filing status and standard deduction.

# ABOUT
The application was made using Java and can be run in the Java console/terminal. It takes a few user inputs and can calculate the income tax liabilty for the user.
The application takes into account the different rates at different tax brackets for Federal, FICA and Mass state tax. The rates change depending on the total income
and which bracket the tax pay ends in. A common misconception, that being in a higher tax bracket is proved wrong in this implemntation as it shows if you make $150,000 the money will get taxed at different rates leading up to 150000.


# How to Run the Application
Fork the Repo and simply run the application in any Java JDK
